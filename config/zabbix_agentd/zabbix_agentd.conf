# This is a configuration file for Zabbix agent daemon (Unix)
# To get more information about Zabbix, visit http://www.zabbix.com
#
# For possible configuration options, 
# see /etc/zabbix_agentd/zabbix_agentd.conf.example

# To make sure all Zabbix configuration is correctly included in IPFire backups:
# - Put custom userparameters in /etc/zabbix_agentd/zabbix_agentd.d/*.conf
# - Put custom scripts in /etc/zabbix_agentd/scripts
# - Put custom modules in /usr/lib/zabbix

# Set your Zabbix Server IP or hostname here (Passive and/or Active):
Server=127.0.0.1
ServerActive=127.0.0.1

# Number of pre-forked instances of zabbix_agentd that concurrently process 
# passive checks.
# On IPFire this is by default set to 3 to minimize the required resources. 
# This parameter can be increased up to 100 if you have a lot of slow-running
# checks, and the agent acts as the bottleneck. 
# Or set to 0 to disable passive checks.
StartAgents=3

# List of comma delimited IP addresses that the agent should listen on
# for passive checks. 
# The agent will not listen on any TCP port when StartAgents is set to 0.
ListenIP=GREEN_ADDRESS

# This line activates IPFire specific userparameters. 
# See IPFire wiki for details.
# To deactivate them: Comment this line out.
# (DO NOT REMOVE OR ALTER IT as then it will be re-added on next upgrade)
