# This file contains the supported ruleset providers.
#
# Each one is defined as a hash in the main hash.
# It's name acts as handle/key and the key/value pair acts as data part.
# So the structure is like the following:
#
# handle => {
# 	summary => A short summary of the service. This also will be shown if no translation string is available for the WUI.
# 	website => The website of the ruleset provider.
# 	tr_string => The translation string which is used by the WUI and part of the language files.
# 	requires_subscription => "True/False" - If some kind of registration code is required in order to download the ruleset.
# 	dl_url => The download URL to grab the ruleset.
# 	dl_type => "archive/plain" - To specify, if the downloaded file is a packed archive or a plain text file.
# },

# Hash which contains the supported ruleset providers.
